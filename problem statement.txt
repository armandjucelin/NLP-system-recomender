We are building a sentiment analysis machine learning recommender system model using the amazon reviews dataset.
We already have the model built using VADER and we need to resume using the machine learning approach.
Some of the key points:
1. Modeling (Sentiment Analysis) Machine Learning approach:
a. Split the data into 70% for training and 30% for testing,—Use stratified splitting
based on the rating value field.

b. Build two sentiment analysis models using 70% of the data. Choose two of the
following Machine Learning algorithms to build your models:
i. Logistic Regression
ii. SVM
iii. Naïve Bayes
iv. Gradient Boosting
2. Note the results of the training process.
3. Testing: Test out the two models using the 30% test data note the accuracy, precision,
recall and F1 score.
4. Compare the test results of the Lexicon model versus the two machine learning models.
5. Review the attached paper “Recommender systems based on user reviews: the state of
the art”, which can also be accessed at the centennial library. Examining the options presented
in the paper carryout the following:
a. Explain how you can enhance the rating values of your data using the review
data.
b. Choose one of the suggested options, and provide diagrams and pseudo-code.
c. Implement the suggestion on your dataset. (Code needs to be provided)
